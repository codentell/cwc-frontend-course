# 11.2 Lesson Plan: Node.js and NPM

## Overview

In this lesson, we will take a deeper dive into the world that is Node.js. We will explore how to take advantage of native modules that come built into Node.js itself. We will access the file system, pass command-line arguments into applications, get acquainted with Node Package Manager (npm), and finally build CLI apps using a package called `inquirer`.


*  To ensure that npm is installed properly, you need to visit the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Run Node.js applications from the command line with arguments.

* Import and use the native `fs` module to read and write to the file system.

* Initialize projects and install third-party modules like `inquirer` using npm.

* Use dependencies and investigate the content of `package.json`.
