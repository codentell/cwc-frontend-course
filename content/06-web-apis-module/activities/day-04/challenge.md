In this Challenge, you'll create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

### Working with Web APIs: Code Quiz
As you proceed in your journey to becoming a front-end web developer, it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding Challenges.

To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week‚Äôs Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week‚Äôs coursework has taught you all the skills you need to succeed in this Challenge.
