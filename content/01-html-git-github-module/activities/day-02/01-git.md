# Git Add, Commit, Push

## Instructions:

* Using GitHub and the command line, do the following:

  * Create a new public GitHub repository and name it whatever you like. Be sure to check the box for “Initialize this repository with a README.”

  * Next, clone the repo to your local directory.

  * Then create an HTML file inside the local directory.

  * Add, commit, and push the code to GitHub.

# BONUS:

  * Create a new public GitHub repository, and name it `zen-garden`. Be sure to check the box for “initialize this repository with a README.”

  * Clone the repo to your local directory.

  * Go to [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). Navigate to a few of the examples and choose a page that you like.

  * Download the HTML and CSS. Each page has a link to download the code, normally near the top of the page.

  * Move the HTML and CSS into your newly cloned repo and open the HTML in Chrome. 

  * Use inspect element to identify a page element you would like to change in some way.

  * Change the CSS in any way you'd like.

  * Add, commit, and push the code to GitHub.
