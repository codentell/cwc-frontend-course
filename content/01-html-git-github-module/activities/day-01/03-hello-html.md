# Notes 

## Pros:

1. `HTML` is easy to learn and understand.
2. `HTML` is platform-independent, which means that it can be used on any operating system and any device.
3. `HTML` is compatible with most web browsers.
4. `HTML` is search engine friendly.
5. `HTML` is relatively secure, since it does not have access to the server when creating web pages.

## Cons:

1. `HTML` pages are static, so they cannot be used for dynamic content.
2. `HTML` does not have any database support, so data must be stored elsewhere.
3. `HTML` is not very flexible, so it can be difficult to change the layout or design of a website.
4. `HTML` is not very secure, since it is easy to hack into an HTML page.
