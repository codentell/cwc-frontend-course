## Overview

In this class, we will be introducing students to the concept of APIs and the use of AJAX calls to retrieve data from external data sources.

## Notes

* Before class, create an account at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) and [GNews](https://gnews.io/register).

* This week's Giphy activities will require students to use an API key from [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/). Please have them create an account and apply for a key before class starts in order to have it approved and activated in time for the activity.
