In this Challenge, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to create a financial analysis tool.

### JavaScript Fundamentals: Console Finances

This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the `index.js` file.

Before you begin, download your starter code below

Challenge and unzip the zip file.

### Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repo called `Console-Finances`. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Copy the starter files into your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

    * You will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.

    * `(Total/Number of months)`

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

```md
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)

```

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

**Hints:**

* You will need to do some research on your own for this project!

* Remember, in order to combine strings and variables in the console, you will need to use concatenation.

* How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?
