# 12.3 Lesson Plan - ES6 Classes

## Overview

In this class, students will learn the benefits of OOP and learn how to apply many OOP practices to their JavaScript applications using ES6 classes.

## Notes

* The primary focus  should be introducing to OOP concepts. Know that it's okay if the new syntax feels overwhelming. The purpose of this lesson is to help get comfortable with working with code that's organized with OOP practices.

* Familiar with classes, subclasses, and the `super()` method before class starts.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class will be able to:

* Implement ES6 class syntax to instantiate multiple instances of a single type of object.

* Construct subclasses that inherit features from a common ancestor class.

* Demonstrate "thinking in OOP" by using objects to control the flow of action in an application.
