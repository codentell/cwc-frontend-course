## Overview

Today's class introduces students to test-driven development and unit testing JavaScript applications.

## Notes

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the benefits of test-driven development.

* Use unit tests as a way to define code requirements for code that hasn't been written yet.

* Write unit tests for pre-existing JavaScript functions.

* Use mocks to test side effects such as reading/writing to the file system, printing to the console, and AJAX requests.

* Use the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern to structure test code.
