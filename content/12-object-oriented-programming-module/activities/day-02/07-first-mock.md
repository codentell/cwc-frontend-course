# First Mock

In this activity, you will add code to spy on the `console.log` method.

## Instructions

* Take a moment to examine the `starter/child.js` and `starter/dayCare.js` files. They should be almost identical to the previous example but with a few `console.log`s added to the code.

* Add code to spy on the `console.log` method to ensure that it is called when expected with the correct arguments.

## 💡 Hints

* Use the previous demonstration as a reference for setting up mocks and spies.
