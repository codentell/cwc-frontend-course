| #   | Section Name         | Description |
|:----| ------------------- | :--  |
|Level 01|[HTML CSS Git  & Advanced Git](/01-html-css-git-advanced-css)  |   In `Module 01`, you will introduce to `HTML`, `CSS`, and version control with `Git`. In `Module 02`, you will implement `media queries` and `flexbox` to create a responsive web design. You will also overwrite browser defaults by using a CSS reset and then rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts, such as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.   |
|Level 02|[JavaScript Web API](/02-javascript-web-api) |  In Module 03, fundamentals of `JavaScript`, including variables, primitive types, arrays, and objects. You will also use logical and comparison operators to construct conditional statements and guide you as they write their first functions and algorithms. In `Module 04`, you will be introduced to the `Document Object Model (DOM)` and gain experience using `Web APIs` to manipulate the `DOM`. you will also handle click events using `addEventListener()`, work with keyboard events like `keyup` and `keydown`, and use local and session storage.  |
|Level 03| [Third Party API & Server Side API](/03-third-party-api-server-side-api)| When developers find themselves repeating a task, they tend to look for a way to simplify their workflow. We saw earlier how CSS frameworks were developed to ensure consistency across applications and to expedite developer workflows. Tools with similar goals have emerged in the JavaScript ecosystem. jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It allows us to write fewer lines of code than we'd need to if we were using plain ol' JavaScript to accomplish the same end. jQuery also provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs Some argue that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. You might not see as many job listings for jQuery developers, but it’s an important skill to master as the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code.Also this week we will learn the `Fetch web API` which can data from server-side APIs, like the `OpenWeather AP`. We'll use the fetch() method to make requests, parse through the returned datasets, and convert them to HTML elements. We'll explore how this data is typically formatted, how to look for and handle errors that might arise, and more importantly, how to read documentation when working with server-side APIs. |
|Level 04| [Project 1](/04-project-01) |  |
|Level 05|[Node.js and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ](/05-node-oop)| In Module 09, you will introduce students to Node.js and the concepts of standard libraries, modules, npm, and package.json files.In Module 10, you will cover some crucial object-oriented programming concepts, including constructors, prototypes, polymorphism, and Promises. We will also introduce students to test-driven development and unit tests. Lastly, we will review the basics of ES6 classes and how they can help organize code.|
|Level 06| [Express & SQL](/06-express-sql)| In Module 11, students will learn about important features of the Express.js library. They will learn how to create and configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST routes. Also, they will configure servers to send static files to the client. Students will learn to identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses. They will parse query strings and parameters, send POST requests using Insomnia, and use the Fetch API. Finally, students learn how to create separation of concerns for their routes.In Module 12, you’ll introduce students to the final layer to your tech stack: the database. Students will learn to design a MySQL database capable of storing large amounts of data as well as the tools needed to create, read, update and delete data. Connecting a MySQL database to a Node.js application using an Express.js server is also discussed. |
|Level 07| [Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and Model-View-Controller (MVC)](/07-orm-mvc) | In Module 13, you will teach students to use the ORM library Sequelize to connect to and seed a database. In the process, students will create and configure Sequelize models, use validation tools, encrypt a password using bcrypt, automate functionality with Hooks, and use SQL in literals. Students will also model relationships and relate data between SQL tables using Sequelize associations. With the help of RESTful routes, they will map HTTP verbs to CRUD actions and build custom routes that map to instance methods. Additionally, students will learn to catch errors with try...catch and use async and await instead of Promises. In Module 14, students will use the separation of concerns principle and the MVC framework to build full-stack web apps. They will use Handlebars.js features including expressions, built-in helpers, custom helpers, and partials to build static templates that can render dynamic data. Students will use front-end logic to make requests and pass data to the back end. They will begin by using hardcoded data and transition to using seed data with Sequelize and MySQL. They will use the routes in the Controller to manipulate data in the Model, to serialize Sequelize objects before sending them to the View, and create their own custom middleware for user authentication. Students will also incorporate sessions and cookies using the Sequelize store. They will be introduced to Prettier before starting on the mini-project.   |     
|Level 08| [Project 2](/08-project-02) |  | 
|Level 09| [Computer Science for JavaScript and NoSQL](/09-cs-nosql)| In Module 17, we will shift gears a bit to introduce students to general computer-science concepts as they relate to JavaScript. The end goal is to prepare students for the technical interview portion of the job interview process. While still project-based, this will be a more concept-dense module than students are accustomed to. We will dissect JavaScript and review how code executes at a granular level. We will also learn about closures and how we can leverage them in our code. We will compare inheritance and composition in application design. And we will review search algorithms and recursion in JavaScript. The Module 17 activities are especially aimed at helping students gain practice experience in interviews and help move them from classroom learners to career-ready developers. Please allow time to share with the class your own experiences as a seasoned industry professional -- as you are comfortable -- in both interviews and on the job. In addition, the activities are built to allow time for conversations centered the key concepts to help the students gain confidence in both asking questions and explaining their ideas to others. For the Module 17 mini-project, students will practice the technical interview portion of a mock interview for a web-developer job with their peers. They'll address topics that are foundational to improving code performance and commonly found in technical interviews. In Module 18, you will introduce students to NoSQL databases and performing CRUD operations using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL document-based database. Students will also learn how to use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, to enforce a specific schema on data and handle data relationships. Deployment of an application using Mongo Atlas and Heroku is also discussed.  |
|Level 10|[Progressive Web Applications (PWA) and React](/10-pwa-react) | In Module 19, students will learn about Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) and the tools used to create them. Some of these tools—such as webpack, service workers, and IndexedDB—are not exclusive to PWAs. They are just a few of the many pieces that make up the PWA framework. Tools like webpack and workbox can optimize and boost the performance of web applications so that more users can comfortably use a web application. This module is a precursor to the upcoming React module, because webpack is an important part of React. While learning about PWAs, students will gain exposure to the client-server architecture, which is different from the MVC model that they had been using in previous weeks. In Module 20, you will teach students how to create a React single-page application (SPA) from the ground up. Through this process, students will learn about components, state, props, React styling, and how to test React applications. They will also learn how to use create-react-app to scaffold their React apps. You will help them render elements in JSX and write JSX expressions. You will also help them understand more complex topics like React Hooks, fetching data, and creating fully functional React forms. | 
|Level 11|[Mern and State ](/11-mern-state) | In Module 21, students will apply their knowledge of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to develop the tools needed to build a full-stack MERN app. Students will learn how to use React Router to add dynamic client-side routing to apps, which makes it possible for users to bookmark URLs and use the browser’s forward and back buttons. They'll also learn GraphQL, an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs that provides declarative data fetching. Finally, students will add authentication to a MERN app by using a JSON Web Token. In Module 22, you will introduce complex state management techniques and review the key tools needed to build a MERN-stack app with routing and authentication. Students will also be introduced to the Stripe payment platform.|
