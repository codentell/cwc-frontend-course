# Module 15: Final Projects

## Overview

Welcome to the Final Project! You are nearing the end of your journey in this class. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design for a client-side single-page application.

Because you will be working collaboratively, you will continue to use agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project

* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project

* Resolve merge conflicts

* Design, build, and deploy a client-side single-page application using Netlify

* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

## Project

With your team or solo, you'll conceive and execute a design for a client-side single-page application. You will implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.

You will write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project as a means to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.


# Final Project

## Application Requirements

You and your group will use everything youâ€™ve learned to create a real-world client-side single-page application that youâ€™ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:

* Must use ReactJS.

* Must use Node.

* Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Must deploy this application using Netlify.

* Must utilize at least two libraries, packages, or technologies that we haven't discussed.

* Must have a polished front end/UI.

* Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

Use this [project presentation template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_u8TKy5zW5UlrVQVnyDEZ0unGI2tjQPDEpA0FNuBKAw/edit?usp=sharing) to address the following: 

* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application.

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and group roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for future development

* Links to to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
