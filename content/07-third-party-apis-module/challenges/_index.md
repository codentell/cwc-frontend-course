In this Challenge, you'll create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

Third-Party APIs: Daily Planner App
This Challenge will require you to leverage all the skills you've learned so far, requiring you to think about DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript, integration of third-party APIs, and more. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

### User Story
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

### Acceptance Criteria
The app should:

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page.


### Mock-Up
