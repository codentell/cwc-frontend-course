## Overview

In this class, we will perform DOM manipulations that students are already familiar with, except this time we'll be using jQuery. We will use the equivalent strategy of traversing down the DOM tree through child elements from the parent element.

## Learning Objectives

We will use jQuery to do the following:

* Create and select DOM elements.

* Assign content or styling to a DOM element.

* Append, prepend, and replace elements to the DOM.

* Traverse the DOM through child elements.

* Attach event listeners and their corresponding event handling functionality.

* Delegate events for elements that have been dynamically created.
