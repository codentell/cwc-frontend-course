# 🏗️ Create a Wireframe

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to see how my elements will be grouped together so that I can better design my website.

The following image shows a wireframe that depicts the web application's appearance and functionality:

2. Using the tools highlighted in the following image, create a wireframe that includes all the elements that you need for the project:

# Wireframing Solved

## Explanation and Result

* We started with our header and sub-heading already defined which leaves us with the body and footer to complete.

* We move down our page to create three elements on the same row.

* When we move onto the coding phase of this mini-project you will note that we will be placing these three elements into a container. This container will determine how our elements sit on the row of our web page.

* Inside of our row that is highlighted in red, we see a blue highlighted box which determines how elements sit on the column.

* The container which holds our column acts similar to our row container but on the opposite axis.

* We repeat the steps above to create the next row of our website.

* Finally, we reached the footer of our website which is simply a blocked off area at the bottom of the page.
